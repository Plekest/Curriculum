            <h2><span class="letra_Maior">Professional Profile</span></h2>
            <p><span class="letra_Maior">I</span> am a dedicated student in the field of Analysis and Development of
                Systems, always looking to learn more and keep up to date with market news. I'm a
                outgoing and communicative person, able to relate well with the people around me.
                In addition, I have a strong leadership spirit and am proactive in challenging situations. I have
                skills to manage contact with people, which allows me to work in a team of
                efficient manner. I have already participated in volunteer work, in which I could develop my skills
                social and communication. I studied for 5 years for military exams, and I realized that I had a lot of
                ease with logic and mathematics, which motivated me even more to pursue a career in the area of
                technology and programming. I've always been comfortable with technology and computers, and I'm excited
                to
                apply my skills to contribute to the success of the company.</p>
